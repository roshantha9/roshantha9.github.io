Hi ! I'm Rosh Mendis, a Senior R&D Scientist at the [Research Center for Information Technology Innovation in Academia Sinica, Taiwan](https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw) and co-director of the [Embedded and Mobile Computing Lab](https://emclab.citi.sinica.edu.tw/). 

My research interests lie broadly in the design and optimization of embedded systems.
In recent years, my work has centered on Intermittent TinyML, enabling intermittently powered, microcontroller-based, battery-less devices to run deep neural networks reliably and efficiently. 
Looking ahead, my research is expanding toward Sustainable TinyML, with a particular emphasis on reducing the carbon footprint of tiny intelligent devices.
Prior to entering academia I have worked as a software engineer in UK, Singapore, and Taiwan.
