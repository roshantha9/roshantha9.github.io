Hi! I'm Rosh Mendis, a Senior R&D Scientist at the [Research Center for Information Technology Innovation in Academia Sinica, Taiwan](https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw) and co-director of the [Embedded and Mobile Computing Lab (EMCLab)](https://emclab.citi.sinica.edu.tw/). 

I obtained my MSc. in Digital Systems Engineering from the Department of Electronics, University of York, in 2011, and later completed my EngD in Large Scale Complex IT Systems from the Department of Computer Science, University of York, in 2017, where I was also a member of the [Real-Time Systems Group](https://www.york.ac.uk/computer-science/research/groups/real-time-distributed-systems/).
Between 2018 and 2024 I was a Postdoctoral Researcher within the EMCLab at Academia Sinica. Prior to entering academia I have worked as a Software Engineer in UK, Singapore, and Taiwan.

My research interests lie broadly in the design and optimization of embedded systems.
In recent years, my work has centered on Intermittent TinyML, enabling intermittently powered, microcontroller-based, battery-less devices to run deep neural networks reliably and efficiently. 
Looking ahead, my research is expanding toward Sustainable TinyML, with a particular emphasis on reducing the carbon footprint of tiny intelligent devices.
